    <h2> About MindSite </h2>

    <p>Upon seeing Singaporean Youth struggle to sieve through pages of Mental Wellness resources, a group of students sought to create a solution for greater access to Mental Wellness. And thus, MindSite was born! In partnership with Strengthening Youths in a Network of Care (SYNC), MindSite seeks to provide a filterable database of verified mental wellness resources tailored to each individual's needs.</p>

    <h2> Our Mission </h2>

    <p>MindSite is a platform that eases Youths’ search for Mental Health resources, all while keeping in mind each youth’s particular needs.<br> We aim to empower youths to seek the mental support they need easily.</p>
